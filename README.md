# Next.js 15 Server Components Nested Data Fetching Bug

This repository demonstrates a potential bug in Next.js 15's server components when dealing with deeply nested data fetching. The issue occurs when fetching data within a server component triggers another data fetch in a child component. This can lead to unexpected behavior, including incomplete data rendering or, in severe cases, infinite loops.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the console and the rendered output to see the unexpected behavior.  The `nestedDataFetchBug.js` file demonstrates the buggy behavior. The `nestedDataFetchSolution.js` provides a working solution.

## Solution

The provided solution emphasizes using more efficient data fetching strategies and possibly data normalization to reduce the need for excessively nested data fetches within server components. Avoiding redundant fetches is key.
