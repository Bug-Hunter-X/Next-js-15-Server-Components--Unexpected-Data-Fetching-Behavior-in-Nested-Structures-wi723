In Next.js 15, a subtle bug can occur when using server components with deeply nested data fetching.  If a server component fetches data that then triggers another data fetch within a deeply nested component structure, it can lead to unexpected behavior.  This might manifest as incomplete data rendering, or in some cases, infinite loops, where data fetching requests continue endlessly.
